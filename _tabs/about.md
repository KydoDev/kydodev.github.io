Hello everyone! I'm Libero Bitondi alias KydoDev, a passionate XR (Extended Reality) developer with a strong background in the field.

I want to share my professional journey, skills, and some interesting projects I have worked on with all of you. I use this blog to share guides and information of my interest that I gather and study from around the web. I often find myself creating small or large projects that I publicly share on my GitHub.
